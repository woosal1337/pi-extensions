# pi-minimal-footer

Minimal footer for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) that replaces the default footer with a compact two-line display: context gauge on top, subscription usage bars below.

## Features

- **Context gauge** — optional working directory and git branch, model, thinking level, and context window usage with token counts
- **Subscription usage bars** — rolling window quotas with reset timers for supported providers
- **Shared usage cache** — all pi instances share one cached result per provider and account, so opening more sessions doesn't mean more quota API calls
- **Git integration** — branch name, dirty state, ahead/behind counts
- **Extension statuses** — text that other extensions set with `ctx.ui.setStatus()`, on its own line like pi's default footer

## Supported providers

| Provider       | What it shows                                          |

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@ogulcancelik/pi-minimal-footer
```

## Configuration

Environment variables (all optional):

| Variable                        | Description                                              | Default |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `PI_MINIMAL_FOOTER_SHOW_CWD`    | Show current working directory in footer status line     | `1`     |
| `PI_MINIMAL_FOOTER_SHOW_BRANCH` | Show git branch/dirty/ahead/behind in footer status line | `1`     |
| `PI_MINIMAL_FOOTER_SHOW_PROVIDER` | Show provider/full-model-id instead of the short model ID | `0`     |

Accepted false values: `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` (case-insensitive).

## How it works

The footer reads context usage from the last assistant message's token counts (free — comes with every LLM response). Subscription usage is fetched from each provider's dedicated quota API using your existing auth tokens from Pi's agent directory (`~/.pi/agent/auth.json` by default) or environment variables.

Usage is cached in `~/.pi/agent/pi-minimal-footer/` and shared by every pi instance. Each instance re-reads the cache on startup, on model switch (Ctrl+P), and every 30 seconds. Only one instance fetches when the cache is older than 5 minutes. Failed fetches keep the last good numbers and retry after a minute, or after the provider's `retry-after` when rate-limited.

Git state is refreshed:

- Once on startup
- When pi reports a branch change
- At the end of each turn

The footer adapts to narrow terminals by stacking lines vertically instead of the single-line wide layout.

## Known issues

### Claude Max usage bar not showing

Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (`/api/oauth/usage`) rate-limits requests by `User-Agent`. Anything other than Claude Code gets persistent 429s ([claude-code#30930](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/30930)), so the footer identifies as `claude-code/<version>`. The limit is still tight, so with many pi sessions open the bar may briefly keep showing the last known values.

## Notes

- Replaces the default pi footer entirely via `ctx.ui.setFooter()`
- Auth tokens are read from Pi's `auth.json` (populated by `/login`) or standard env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, etc.). The footer respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, including paths starting with `~/`.
- Providers without auth simply don't show a usage bar — no errors
